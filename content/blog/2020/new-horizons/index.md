After being self-employed for most of the last decade, I recently decided it was time for a change of pace.

In late January, I [dissolved the LLC for my consultancy, Uptime Ventures][uv], in order to accept a senior-level engineering position from a local company where I'll be tasked, in part, with expanding their use of Rust. This role feels like a natural fit, since my last year was spent contributing to Rust's `async` networking stack and various web frameworks in the ecosystem.

On a personal note, I'm glad for an opportunity to *use* tools instead of *building* them, which has been my focus of late.

I sign on later this month. With any luck, this new role will see me become more involved in local and international Rust communities, not less.
