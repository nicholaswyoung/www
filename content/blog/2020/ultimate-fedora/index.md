In 2020, Linux users aren't hurting for choice. Two of the largest
distributions, Debian and Ubuntu, both cater to anyone who requires long-term
stability and wide hardware support. Opposite these goals, Arch strives to
deliver the absolute latest software to an audience of engineers. In between,
you'll find a handful of distributions like Void, Nix, and Linux Mint all
serving unique audiences with exacting tastes.

However, there is one major distribution of Linux that I've left so far
unnamed: Fedora. While the project is sponsored by Red Hat, Fedora seems to
operate with more autonomy than is afforded to openSUSE.
