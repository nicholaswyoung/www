Since the last design refresh of this site, dark interfaces began to appear in mainstream design trends. Maybe it's because a majority of my work once took place after nightfall, but I've always favored dark color palettes.

After noticing that design trends were finally shifting darker, I implemented
user-selectable color schemes; a process I found unexpectedly difficult. I'm
not alone in this observation: other design nerds have pointed it out too,
most notably Chris Coyier, [who listed out requirements for dark mode
tutorials][dark-mode-requirements] on his influential web design blog, [CSS
Tricks][css-tricks].

Like many emerging ideas on the web, "dark mode" is complex because it exists at the intersection of several developing technologies.
