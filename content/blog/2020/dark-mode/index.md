Since the last design refresh of this site, dark interfaces began to [appear in
mainstream design publications][designshack].

Maybe it's because a majority of my work once took place after nightfall, but
I've always favored dark color palettes. After noticing that trends were
finally shifting darker, I implemented user-selectable color schemes; a process
I found unexpectedly difficult. I'm not alone in this observation: other design
nerds have pointed it out too, most notably Chris Coyier, [who listed out
requirements for dark mode tutorials][dark-mode-requirements] on his
influential web design blog, [CSS Tricks][css-tricks].

Like many emerging ideas on the web, "dark mode" is complex because it exists
at the intersection of several developing techniques. Choosing the right tools
to develop a solution can be difficult, even for seasoned engineers.

## What is "Dark Mode" Anyway?

The central principle of "dark mode" is swapping the dark-on-light color palette that has become the norm in modern design for a light-on-dark version. This has several benefits, not the least of which is reducing eye strain. Software engineers have used high-constrast, low-brightness themes for years to combat fatigue and restlessness after spending a long evening in front of a screen. Surprisingly, this trend only recently entered the mainstream.
